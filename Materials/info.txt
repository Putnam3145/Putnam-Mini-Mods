[DESCRIPTION:Adds some ores and extra alloys for use with the standard metals library mod.]

[STEAM_TITLE:Materials Plus]
[STEAM_DESCRIPTION:Adds a few alloys and a bunch of ores to get some of the extra materials added by the metal library. It might be better to have the minerals in the metal library? I dunno. I prefer to keep things modular, when possible, which it is now. Woo!]
