[DESCRIPTION:Adds a bunch of metals to be used by other mods.]

[STEAM_TITLE:Elemental metals library]
[STEAM_DESCRIPTION:Adds a bunch of metals, with no way to access them. This is intended to be used as a library for other mods. You can use a token--"Materials Plus" demonstrates its use--to ensure that your mod uses this. The workshop probably has requirements built-in, I'll edit this description later, it's no problem.]
